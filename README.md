[ideas]
## Idea #1: Ethereum dApp Starter Blocklet 

A demo application for users to oneclick to generate and deploy a Ethereum started scaffold.

## Idea #2: Trust-less Upgradable Smart-contract Proposal

This is an article my team is writing and plan to share to Ethereum Magician this month and proposing a Trust-less Upgradable Smart-contract, the open source repo is in another github repo.
